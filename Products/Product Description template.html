The A8A is the top of the AVENTAGE line, making it the best of the best. Experience room-filling sound and crystal-clear picture with this innovative AV receiver.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-6"> <h2>Compressed Music Enhancer</h2> <p>When music is encoded into a digitally compressed format like MP3, the frequency response suffers. The Yamaha Compressed Music Enhancer employs sophisticated digital signal processing using exclusive algorithms to restore what was lost, so the music always sounds the way it should.</p> <h2>Surround:AI</h2> <p>This artificial intelligence (AI) technology built into the DSP analyzes the scene of the entertainment content, then creates the optimal surround effect to reproduce it with the ultimate impact. This AI instantaneously analyzes scenes by focusing on distinct sound elements, such as dialogue, background music, ambient sounds, and sound effects, and automatically optimizes the surround effect in real time. Imagine having a Yamaha sound engineer listening right next to you, tuning the best sound live and specifically for you. This AI technology creates a compelling sense of realism with expressive power beyond conventional sound field effects, giving you the most profound entertainment experience possible. The Qualcomm QCS407 chip with 64-bit high-precision processing delivers precise surround sound.</p> <h2>CINEMA DSP HD3 for Movies, Music, and Games</h2> <p>This Yamaha flagship 3D sound field playback technology was created by combining actual measured sound field data with digital signal processing technology. The revamped CINEMA DSP HD3 features new signal processing algorithms and maximizes theater sound effects, accurately reproducing a new dimension of realism for a sound field with a rich sense of presence and no feeling of boundaries. By using front, center, and surround speakers to create a rear virtual speaker, CINEMA DSP HD3 playback of up to 11.1 channels is possible (with a front presence speaker), even with a 7.1-channel speaker configuration.</p> <h2>DTS:X</h2> <p>DTS:X immersive audio formatting places sound where it would naturally occur in space, creating lifelike, multidimensional audio. The included spatial remapping engine of DTS Neural:X offers improved immersion and heightened realism in all your favorite movies.</p> <h2>Newly Designed Mechanical Structure</h2> <p>The symmetrical internal layout of parts and totally renewed circuit boards are designed to keep the signal paths on each board as short as possible. The new H-cross frame improves the rigidity of the receiver body and sound stability, allowing for clearer, sharper, and more transparent reproduction. Also, the newly redesigned mechanical structure contributes to avoiding the transition of vibration from the transformer to the amplifier circuit. Sound noises are reduced to improve clarity.</p> <h2>Voice Control via Your Alexa-, Google Assistant-, and Siri-Enabled Devices</h2> <p>Via your voice assistant-enabled devices on the same network, the receiver easily works with Alexa, the Google Assistant and Siri (via AirPlay 2), so your it is always at your command and your whole home can come alive.</p> </div> <div class="col-sm-6"> <h3>Product Features:</h3> <div class="product-features"> <ul> <li>Pandora, Spotify, Napster, SiriusXM, TIDAL, Deezer, Qobuz, and Amazon Music HD</li> <li>Virtual Presence Speaker & Virtual Surround Back Speaker</li> <li>High-resolution Music Enhancer</li> <li>Adaptive DRC (dynamic range control)</li> <li>Zone 4 audio output via HDMI</li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>
